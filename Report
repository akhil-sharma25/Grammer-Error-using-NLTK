Project Discription-

We have created project to find gramatical error in a given text using NLTK and correcting the given text.Input is given by creating another 
file named TestingData.txt and output is created in CorrectedData.txt and file input is given in TrainingData.txt.

Screenshots- Screenshots are uploaded in .PNG files in the project itself.

Installation Process-
Upload the given code in the Jupyter Ipython notebook.

Detailed Discription-
We have used libraries like NLTK and Numpy. Using training data we took input and analysed on our test data which automatically created output in our
correctingData.txt . First of all the input sentence is splitted to every single word using tokenize . If a sentence is of 3 words
it is assumed that it is already correct and if a sentence is of 5 words it can at max have a single error , but if the sentence is more then 5 words
it can have multiple corrections. So function of every gram is created and in our main code we took 3 different case as stated above. Now all the words 
of sentence are splitted and using ngrams sentence is joined. Bigrams and Trigrams are mainly used which joined the 2 words at a time and 3 at a time respectively.
The sentence with most probabilty is given as output. Splitting of senteces is given by tokenize and joining is done by ngrams.
